Now therefore be it resolved that City Council commits a total sum of $115,000. - $30,000. to come from the existing Public Works and Transportation Department Roads Budget and balance of $85,000. to come from the 2001 Year End Surplus for the labour and equipment costs required to do ditching and install culverts and to apply and grade gravel that is being provided by the Province to improve the roadway; and  Further be it resolved that City Council confirms the existing status of Red Rock Road as a seasonal road only not eligible for winter maintenance.

Marie for Economic Diversification; and  Whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie will be expected to provide some financial contribution towards eligible projects deemed worthy of Federal and/or Provincial funding assistance; and  Whereas both senior levels of government have made it clear that assistance will be provided only for well defined and viable projects which achieve the objectives of their programs for economic diversification and only for projects deemed to be of the highest priority for our community;  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council approves the transfer of the sum of $1.309 million from the 2001 Year End Surplus into a Reserve Account for Economic Diversification to be combined with the $2.5 million expected to be created in the 2002 Budget as savings resulting from the recently announced Capital Assistance grant Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation towards this year’s Capital Roadwork Program; and  Further be it resolved that funds in this Economic Diversification Reserve only be used to lever Federal and/or Provincial assistance and private sector investment for clearly defined projects which will help diversify our City’s economy and which are of the highest priority as determined by City Council in accordance with recommendations   from   the   “Getting   On   With   It”   Economic   Diversification Strategy.

Manzo  Whereas   as   Canadians   who   entered   into   a   North   American   Free   Trade Agreement we understood that this meant there was unencumbered free trade between Canada and the United States;  Whereas   the   softwood   lumber   agreement   between   Canada   and   the   United States expired on March 31, 2001 and the U.S. Department of Commerce has subsequently   implemented   anti-dumping   and   countervailing   duties   totalling 27.22% on Canadian softwood lumber;  Whereas the 27.22% tariffs effective on May 23, 2002 will result in an estimated $3 billion paid directly to lumber barons in the U.S. every year;  Whereas on three separate occasions over the past 20 years similar U.S. claims that Canadian softwood lumber is subsidized were found to be unsubstantiated;  Whereas Canada over the past year has sought a durable, long-term solution to the softwood lumber dispute through negotiations with the U.S. and the U.S. has rejected all proposals presented;  Whereas the forest industry contributes $34 billion in trade and $9.5 billion in taxes to Canada annually and 1200 communities depend substantially on this trade and 350 communities rely entirely on the strength of the forest industry for their prosperity;  Whereas the impacts of these tariffs are also affecting American consumers wanting to build affordable housing and to renovate their homes;  Whereas the result of this trade dispute could impact the trade of other Canadian commodities such as energy, agricultural products and steel;  Be It Resolved that the Federal and Provincial/territorial governments recognize that the Canadian Forest Industry must have unencumbered access to the U.S. market and therefore governments must pursue all avenues of activity to provide sure access including dialogue and discussions as well as legal avenues through the WTO and NAFTA;  Be It Resolved that the Federal Government work closely with, and support,the provinces/territories to ensure that all parties remain united in reaching a long- term solution that recognizes unrestricted free trade and that as Canadians we must stand united to not fall prey to U.S. protectionism; and Be It Further Resolved that this resolution be communicated to our Member of Parliament,   the   Prime   Minister,   the   Minister   of   International   Trade,   federal opposition   leaders,   and   the   Federation   of   Canadian   Municipalities.

Marie should “Go for the Gold” and strive for 100% smoke free in public places in our community; and  Whereas it is recognized that many local establishments and organizations have made business decisions on the basis of the phasing-in of the by-law; and  Whereas it is the intention of City Council to “Go for the Gold” and become 100% smoke free;  Now therefore be it resolved that the City Solicitor be instructed to prepare and bring forward to City Council for its consideration a by-law which achieves 100% smoke free in public places and which becomes effective on June 1, 2004, after all of the restrictions contained in the current by-law have become effective.

(PUC)   operates   as   an   electricity   distribution business serving the City of Sault Ste. Marie; and  Whereas PUC has a power supply contract with Great Lakes Power (GLP) dating back to 1928, which is of mutual benefit to both parties and to electricity users in Sault Ste. Marie; and 7.   (b)   Whereas the contract is for an all inclusive fixed price (excluding taxes) until December 31, 2003, with the ability to extend the contract to December 31, 2008 if a price can be agreed upon by the parties and is approved by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB); and  Whereas PUC continues to receive power through the GLP transmission system which GLP has agreed will be under the operating control of the Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO); and  Whereas effective May 1, 2002 due to the new electricity market rules, PUC is now being invoiced by the Independent Market Operator (IMO) for various fees imposed by the IMO which are being billed in addition to the amounts being billed to PUC by GLP under the contract; and  Whereas the imposition of the fees charged by the IMO under the new market rules result in additional annual charges in excess of $3 million to the ratepayers of Sault Ste. Marie; and  Whereas   the   PUC   was   in   a   unique   situation   prior   to   market   opening   and migration to the new market rules affect Sault Ste. Marie to a greater extent than other communities in the Province and impedes the operation of the existing contract between GLP and PUC; and  Whereas the OEB has stated in Decision RP-2000-0069 that \"one size may not fit all\" and the PUC had understood that it was Government policy that electricity restructuring would not negatively impact existing contracts between municipal utilities and private utilities like GLP; and  Whereas the result of strictly applying the new market rules would be contrary to the intent of Bill 35 in that one of the objectives is \"to protect the interests of consumers with respect to prices and the reliability and quality of electricity service\",  Now Therefore Be It Resolved that the Provincial Government be asked to review the unique situation in Sault Ste. Marie in order to provide a fair and equitable   solution   to   the   citizens   of   Sault   Ste.   Marie   as   a   result   of   the Government's deregulation of the electricity market. CARRIED.
